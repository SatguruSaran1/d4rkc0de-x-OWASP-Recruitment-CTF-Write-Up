PHP endpoint at http://192.168.1.250:6767/ accepts POST requests and on wrong guesses it prints the MD5 of the real flag and the MD5 of your guess. On success it prints the flag.
The code compares md5($flag) == md5($guess) using == instead of === and because of ==  when both operands look like numbers, PHP converts them to numbers and compares numerically.
If both hashes are strings that match the pattern (start with "0e" and are followed only by digits) both will be = 0, making the == comparison return true.
I had to use assistance of ai as I was unfamiliar with this topic.
