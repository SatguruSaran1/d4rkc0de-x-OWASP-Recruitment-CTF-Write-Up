The program swapped adjacent input bytes and XORED with xr_array.
it then checked with check_array so input could be found using a python script which xors adjacent check_array and xr_array.
Read the .data section and grab the two arrays.
Then generate a python script in which input[j] = check_array[j^1] ^ xr_array[j^1].
